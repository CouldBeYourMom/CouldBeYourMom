## Welcome — I'm CouldBeYourMom 👋

I'm an undergraduate at The University of Florida, studying Computer Science and preparing to apply for a dual degree in Psychology, with a focus on developmental and cognitive computational neuroscience. My interests center around how the brain develops and adapts — particularly in response to technology — and how neural and physiological systems support cognition and behavior in dynamic, real-world environments.

If you’re wondering about the username: yes, there’s a story behind it. When I first started learning to code through The Odin Project, my teenage son helped me come up with a GitHub handle. Joking about my age compared to most of my classmates, we landed on “CouldBeYourMom” — and it’s stuck with me ever since. It began as a light-hearted moment but has become a meaningful part of my coding journey.

This space documents the work I’ve done and the work I’m still learning to do — thanks for stopping by!
